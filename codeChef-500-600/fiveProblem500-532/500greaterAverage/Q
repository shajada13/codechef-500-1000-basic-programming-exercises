Greater Average

You are given 3 numbers A, B, and C.
Determine whether the average of A and B is strictly greater than C or not.

Definition:
The average of A and B is defined as:
Average = (A + B) / 2

Examples:
Average of 5 and 9 is 7
Average of 5 and 8 is 6.5

Input Format:
- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of 3 integers A, B, and C.

Output Format:
- For each test case, output YES if average of A and B is strictly greater than C.
- Otherwise, output NO.
- You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase 
  (for example: YES, yes, YeS will all be treated as identical).

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 10
